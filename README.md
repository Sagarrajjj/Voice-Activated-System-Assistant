# Voice-Activated-System-Assistant
Voice-Activated System Assistant This project is a Python-based, voice-activated assistant that transcribes spoken commands, sends them to a large language model (LLM), and executes the returned system command on a Windows machine. It serves as a proof-of-concept for creating an intelligent, hands-free interface for your computer, combining speech.
